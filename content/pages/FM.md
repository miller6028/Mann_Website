The FM radio stations of WLT are owned and operated by their
respective originating stations. The translator licenses are granted to
the station owners. These radio stations have affirmed their commitment
to serving the Florence community by becoming User Members of West Lane
Translator, Inc, and they share equally in the ongoing costs associated
with keeping the WLT facilities operational.

Our FM radio stations providing programming are listed in the table
below in order of their Florence frequencies.  Clicking on either a
Station or Translator Callsign will take you to more detailed
information (including contact information) about it on the FCC's
website.
