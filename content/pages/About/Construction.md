West Lane Translator Incorporated owns and operates a substantial
communications tower in the Florence, Oregon market. Our facilities are
located at the top of Glenada Hill, south of the Siuslaw River and Old
Town Florence. We currently have available tower inventory at all levels
for lease. [Contact us]({filename}Contact.md) for a consultation on
how we can assist your business in achieving its communications goals.

* COVERAGE
: Whether your requirements are for point-to-point, land mobile two-way,
  cellular, broadcast or broadband, West Lane Translator can supply the
  most complete coverage in Florence and western Lane County. Our
  240-foot, self-supporting tower has unobstructed line-of-sight to all
  of the Florence market, as well as Dunes City/Westlake, parts of
  Siltcoos Lake, Highway 101 from Heceta Head to north Douglas County
  and east up Highway 126 as far as Mapleton.  No other tower in the
  area provides as much open propagation as WLT's.

* SECURITY
: Public access to the private forest land surrounding WLT's compound is
  restricted by locked gates and patrolled by the landowner. The tower
  and supporting facilities are further protected by security fencing
  and a second locked gate.

* RELIABILITY
: The Valmont tower at our facility was designed and built to survive
  a 9.0 earthquake, it meets all current tower specifications.
  Additionally, WLT maintains a permanently-installed, 40kW diesel
  generator to provide backup power to user's equipment in the event
  of a power failure. The site is served by utility power, underground
  telephone service, and fiber-optic cable. Three-phase utility power
  is nearby.

* STABILITY
: West Lane Translator has maintained this site since 1959. Continuing
  stewardship of this facility is one of WLT's primary goals.

* EASE OF ACCESS
: Our facilities are accessible year-round due to the relatively mild
  weather in this part of the state. The gravel road into the site is
  well-maintained, and not overly rugged. Four-wheel-drive is not a
  necessity to access the site. Sanitary facilities are provided for the
  use of our tenants, workers and visitors as well as personnel of
  adjoining facilities.

* ROOM TO GROW
: All levels of the tower are available for the mounting of antenna
  apparatus. If your equipment installation needs are modest, we have
  equipment rack space available in our climate-controlled main
  building. If you need more space, we have a 12' by 26' fully
  air-conditioned facility ready to occupy.  Users needing their own
  equipment shelters will find that there is ample area adjacent to
  the tower, needing minimal preparation for use. Base-of-tower
  outdoor-installed equipment is easily accommodated as well.

* VALUE
: WLT's lease offerings are competitively priced.
